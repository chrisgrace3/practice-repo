Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?

    Data structures in Ruby allow you to handle, organize, and keep track of
    large collections of data and variables.

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.

    An array is an object that can store a list or collection of other objects.
    An array consists of a variable name assignment, which will evaluate to
    a list of object nested inside of square brackets. Each item is separated by
    a comma. You can evaluate an object inside of an array by accessing its index.

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.

    ex.1: A variable titled 'primary_colors' that evaluates to an array
    containing the RGB colors as strings.
      e.g.: primary_colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]

    ex.2: A variable titled 'soft_drinks' that evaluates to an array of strings
    denoting popular soft drinks.
      e.g.: soft_drinks = ["Coca-Cola", "Pepsi", "Sprite", "Dr. Pepper"]

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.

    A Hash is a data structure that contains data in the form of key and value
    pairs. These key/value pairs are housed between curly braces ({}) and are
    separated each separated by commas.

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.

    ex.1: Application data which pulls from a form that accepts information
    about a person, i.e. name, age, location, etc.
      e.g.: application = {name: "Chris Grace", age: "immortal", location: "Earth"}

    ex.2: Items in different rooms of a house.
      e.g.:
      house = {
      'living room' => ['sofa', 'TV', 'coffee table'],
      'bedroom' => ['bed', 'dresser', 'lamp']
      }

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?

    Iteration is useful because it allows you to access and evaluate each object
    in a data structure individually with a single block of code.

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.

    An online form that allows a user to update information they have entered
    previously (e.g. address).

Blocks
8. What is a block?
    A "block", in Ruby, is a block of code that can be used as a 'mini-program'
    that typically is used to iterate on a data structure.

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
    A block parameter is a 'variable' that can be used within a block to take
    data from elsewhere and run it through the block itself. The data that takes
    the code being run within the block via this parameter comes from the method
    you are calling.
